# GDD - "SCAV"

## Synopsis
SCAV is set in a distant, post-apocalyptic future. Surviving humans are
almost entirely robotically augmented. A few scavengers uncover an abandoned
underground research facility on a quest to find a powerful artifact. They
unwittingly awaken the facility's dormant security system, and must find the
artifact and escape, or be destroyed...

## Gameplay Overview
SCAV is an asymmetric online multiplayer game, where up to three FPS players
infiltrate a facility controlled by a fourth player. This player plays from a
top-down RTS perspective and must control units and set traps to prevent the
other team from reaching the objective.

## Visual style
The game's world is composed of clean, polygonal shapes, shaded with solid
colours or gradients. Textures are sparingly used in favour of coloured,
sub-divided meshes to create crisp outlines.

The overall tone of the facility is: sterile, ominous, unwelcoming.
Architecturally it its composed of straight edges, puzzle-piece rooms, and
long corridors. Lights glow and bloom vividly.

Inspiration: Reflex Arena, Hyper Light Drifter, Half-Life, The Witness,
Journey

UI is kept to a minimum for the FPS players. Information is either inferred
from the game world or the UI is brought up in-world for everyone else to see
(ala Dead Space). e.g. one player can bring up a map while the others gather
around...
